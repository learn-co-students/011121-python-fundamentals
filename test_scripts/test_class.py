class Test():
    """
        Provides a way for students to check their objects against 
        objects created in solution cells

        How to use this class
        ---------------------

        In a solution cell: 

        once you have an object you would like students to replicate,
        call Test().save(object, object_nickname) to pkl the object
        in a class-defined directory

            This will: 
                - check to see if there's a directory at the level of the book called test_obj, 
                and create it if there's not.  (The directory name can be altered 
                with the attribute Test().dir)

                - check to see if there's a file at the path f"test_obj/{object_nickname+'.pkl'}"
                If there is, it is deleted.  (This allows for writing Test().save once and 
                re-saving the object every time the cell is run)

                - pkl the object and save it at the path f"test_obj/{object_nickname+'.pkl'}"

        In a student-facing cell: 

        call Test().run_test(student_object, object_nickname) and have students run the cell
        to check whether their object matches the pkl'd object

            This will: 
                - import the pkl'd object at the path f"test_obj/{object_nickname+'.pkl'}"

                - run an assert against the student-created object "student_object" and the pkl'd object

                - print "Hey, you did it.  Good job" if an AssertError is not thrown, "try again" if one is

                - the variable name of the first parameter is not bound by anything and need not be
                the original name of the object that was pkl'd.  It's up to the instructor whether
                to
                    - tell students to create an object with a specific name, and pre-populate
                    Test.run_test() with that name as the first parameter

                    - not specify a name for students to assign student_object, but rely on
                    the student to place their object as the first parameter for Test.run_test()


        Type-specific assert methods
        ----------------------------

        Some types need additional methods to be asserted.  

        Examples include numpy arrays, pandas series and dataframes.  

        These type-specific methods are run if an object of that type is the first
        parameter for Test().run_test

        A dictionary containing these type-specific assert methods is stored in Test().obj_tests_dict 
        with the type as the key.

        There is a Test().obj_tests_dict_kwargs attribute which contains parameters to pass to 
        type-specific assertion methods.  

        The dataframe assertion method has a "check_like" parameter which ignores the sort order
        and will assert True if identical frames sorted differently are compared.  This class 
        sets "check_like" to True by default.


        Is this robust for students with Windows filepaths?
        ---------------------------------------------------
        Should be!
